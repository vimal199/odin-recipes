    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Tender chopped cabbage with rich, meaty flavor is just a few steps away. You'll find the full recipe below with step-by-step instructions, but here's what you can expect when you make this top-rated recipe:</p>
    <p>Begin by browning ground beef in a skillet over medium-high heat. Drain and discard grease before combining beef with cabbage, tomato sauce, onion, rice, and salt. Pour beef broth over the top, and bake for one hour.</p>
    <ul><h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <li>2 pounds ground</li>
    <li>3 Â½ pounds chopped cabbage</li>
    <li>1 (29 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
    <li>1 cup chopped onion</li></ul>
    <ol><h1>Steps</h1>
   <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
        <li>Combine cabbage, tomato sauce, onion, rice, and salt in a large mixing bowl. Stir in cooked ground beef. Pour mixture into a 9x13-inch baking dish, then pour beef broth over top.</li>
